Some information on preliminary discussions have taken place in the following threads:
* https://josm.openstreetmap.de/ticket/10648 
* http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code/2015/Mapillary_plugin_for_JOSM
* https://trac.openstreetmap.org/browser/subversion/applications/editors/josm/plugins/agpifoj/src/org/openstreetmap/josm/plugins/agpifoj?rev=16290&order=name Old plugin code for Agpifoj which should be the best place to start working from.
